# StreamDataAnalytics
Write a stream data analytics program to build the relationship model between the sensor data and the four parameters (S, D, H, R),  and use the built model to predict the future four parameters per second from future raw sensor data. Python language  is recommended for the stream data analytics program.  Please use first 20 minutes data for training, validation and testing. The remaining 7 minutes  data is used as the new data to calculate/predict each of the four parameters per second and evaluate the MAE (mean absolute error) of  each parameter per second.
